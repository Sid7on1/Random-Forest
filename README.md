# *****Random-Forest*****
This project builds an E-commerce Product Recommendation System using the Random Forest algorithm. It predicts products users are likely to interact with based on behavior features like user activity, product category, ratings, and views. The model aims to enhance user experience and boost sales.
# 🛒 E-commerce Product Recommendation System using Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based recommendation engine that predicts user interest in products on an e-commerce platform. Using the **Random Forest** algorithm, it analyzes user behavior and product features to recommend items likely to convert. The system is designed for personalization, increasing user engagement and boosting overall conversions.

## 🧠 How Random Forest Works

Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve performance.

- **Bootstrap Sampling**: Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data.
- **Random Feature Selection**: At each split, a random subset of features is evaluated to make decisions.
- **Aggregation**: Final predictions are made by majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression).

This method reduces overfitting and provides better generalization than a single decision tree.
